Just so you know, I am still alive...

 

 

...but the sabbatical finally had to come to an end. I'm very excited to enter the world of work once more. No really.

¬\_¬

I'm sure my brand of proactive problem solving will have me going places soon enough...

 

 

...especially seeing as I'm no longer long-haired, bearded, nor a wearer of rock t-shirts, combats or skater shoes i.e. a typical software developer. I now own four suits. _Four_.

 

 

Rest assured, now the upheaval of relocating and job hunting has ceased, blog posts shall once again resume. Possibly not at the rate of two a month (I write software to go with each entry, these things aren't just knocked out in half an hour) but I've found it really enjoyable and worthwhile - I hope to keep it going.
